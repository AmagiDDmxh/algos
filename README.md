## Intro
Upload this repo for the conveniences of NPM package. From now on the codes are massively untasty, I'll try to abstract and refactor on the future.

Codes are most implemented in TypeScript


### File Structure

```bash
  src  # main directory
├──   algorithms
├──   common  # common util
├──   data-structure
├──   playground  # for play
├──   recall  # for revision
├──   typescript  # for typescript
```

### What it have

**Algorithms**
Includes common algorithm like sorting, Techniques like sliding window, and quizes from online platform

- Techniques I learnt from Educative serie of Grokking the Interview which includes
   1. Sliding Window
   2. Dynamic Programming
- Code samples from Leet Code
   - 02 Add two number
- Sorting
   - Ordering Sort
     - Bubble
     - Insertion
     - Selection
   - Categorizing Sort
     - Count
     - Quick
 - Search
   - Binary Search

**Data Structure**

- Contiguous
- Linked
  - Linked List
  - Binary Tree
  - Directed Graph
  - Queue

**TypeScript**
Try out typescript features, may remove in the future

**Recall Section**
Use to rehearsing concepts learned from the past

**Playground**
Playground are use for various reasons, it could be writing a TypeScript type, implement prototype, a small library etc...


### Book Referencs
Books are sorted by the difficulty, from elementary with no Algos background but some programming experience could learn to a bit more sophisticated enhance concepts up to highly complex more abstract data type. Be sure to choice by your own understanding and preferences.
